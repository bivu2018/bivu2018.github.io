                <h3>Date: June 18th, 2018, 09.00-17.15</h3>
                <p class="lead">Together with the <a href="http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/">Computer Vision 
                and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2018</a>.
                </p> 
                
<!--                 This is the evolution of <a href="http://bravenewmotion.github.io/eccv16/index.html">previous CVPR17 and ECCV16 successful workshops -->
                
                
                <h3>Description of the workshop and its relevance</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                In the late years Deep Learning has been a great force of change on most computer vision tasks. In video analysis problems, however, such as action recognition and detection, motion analysis and tracking, shallow architectures remain surprisingly competitive. What is the reason for this conundrum?  Larger datasets are part of the solution. The recently proposed Sports1M and Kinetics helped recently in the realistic training of large motion networks. Still, the breakthrough has not yet arrived.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                Assuming that the recently proposed video datasets are large enough for training deep networks for video, another likely culprit for the standstill in video analysis is the capacity of the existing deep models. More specifically, the existing deep networks for video analysis might not be sophisticated enough to address the complexity of motion information. This makes sense, as videos introduce an exponential complexity as compared to static images. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art motion representation models are extensions of existing image representations rather than motion dedicated ones. Brave, new and motion-specific representations are likely to be needed for a breakthrough in video analysis.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the broad area of video analysis to discuss problem statements, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks that will spur disruptive progress in the field of video understanding. The workshop will include a series of invited talks by leading researchers in this area as well as oral and poster presentations of accepted papers.
                </p>


                <h3>Calling papers for brave new ideas</h3>
                <p class="lead">

                Submissions will be in the form of short non- anonymous papers and will consist of a maximum of 4 pages (excluding references). Submissions must represent new work, i.e., work that has not been previously published or accepted for publication. However, papers that expand previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non peer-reviewed websites (such as arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have a publication proceedings) are acceptable. Accepted papers will be presented as posters or contributed talks. Authors of accepted papers will be asked to post their submissions on arXiv. The workshop website will provide links to the accepted papers on arXiv. Accepted papers will be considered non- archival, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not).
                </p>

                <h3>Expert speakers</h3>
                <p class="lead">

        <b>Title:</b> What have we learned from deep representations for action recognition? </br>
        <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will shed light on deep spatiotemporal representations by visualizing what two-stream models have learned in order to recognize actions in video. I show that local detectors for appearance and motion objects arise to form distributed representations for recognizing human actions. Key observations include the following. First, cross-stream fusion enables the learning of true spatiotemporal features rather than simply separate appearance and motion features. Second, the networks can learn local representations that are highly class specific, but also generic representations that can serve a range of classes. Third, throughout the hierarchy of the network, features become more abstract and show increasing invariance to aspects of the data that are unimportant to desired distinctions (e.g. motion patterns across various speeds). Fourth, visualizations can be used not only to shed light on learned representations, but also to reveal idiosyncracies of training data and to explain failure cases of the system.</br>
